# whereami

This repo is a fork of the GCP [whereami](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/tree/main/quickstarts/whereami) project. I have extended application functionality to serve a webpage with information about the runtime environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure (such as GKE or Cloud Run).

## TODO

* Publish image to [GH Packages and Docker Hub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-github-packages)
